#  Why did Vwin choose the Denver Nuggets as their first NBA team partner? 

Denver is the most populous city in Colorado with over 630,000 residents. The Nuggets are one of the most successful teams in the NBA with 10 conference championships and 3 league championships.

The Nuggets have had a strong following in Denver for many years. In the 2016-17 season, they had the 5th highest average attendance in the NBA with 17,819 fans per game. They also have a very active fan base on social media with over 1.5 million followers on Twitter and Instagram combined.

Vwin is looking to partner with elite teams and athletes that have a large following and generate a lot of buzz on social media. The Nuggets are a perfect partner for Vwin because they have both a large fan base and are very active on social media.

#  How do bacon and the Nuggets connect? 

Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone has a great affinity for bacon, and he’s not alone. In fact, an estimated $1 billion is spent on bacon each year in the United States. That’s a lot of bacon!

What does this have to do with the Nuggets? In the summer of 2018, Denver signed center Mason Plumlee to a 3-year, $41 million contract. Plumlee is a noted lover of bacon, and he was very excited to be able to continue his love affair with the crispy pork strips in Denver.

In a press conference shortly after signing with the Nuggets, Plumlee said, “I am blessed to have this opportunity to play for my hometown team and to continue my love affair with bacon. I can’t wait to get out there and start playing some ball.”

It’s clear that Malone and Plumlee share a passion for bacon, and this could be a key factor in helping the Nuggets achieve success this season. Bacon is not only delicious but it’s also nutritious, providing plenty of protein and other nutrients needed for optimal health.

So next time you tune into a Denver Nuggets game, keep your eyes peeled for Coach Malone chowing down on some delicious bacon. And who knows, you might just see Mason Plumlee stuffing his face with bacon as well!

#  What does this sponsorship mean for fans of both brands? 

When Nike announced their newest endorsement deal with controversial NFL quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, the sports world was set ablaze. As the news reverberated throughout social media and mainstream news outlets, it became clear that this move would be divisive. Fans of Nike and Kaepernick were eager to see how the partnership would play out, while detractors threatened to boycott the brand.

Almost a year later, it seems that Nike’s gamble has paid off. According to a report from Edison Trends, Nike’s online sales have increased by 31% since the Kaepernick campaign launched. And while there are certainly some consumers who have boycotted the brand, Nike’s market share has not declined in any measurable way.

So what does this sponsorship mean for fans of both brands?

For Nike, it means a continued increase in sales and positive publicity. The company has taken a strong stance on social justice issues, and by aligning themselves with Kaepernick they’ve demonstrated their commitment to these causes. This is undoubtedly good for business, as it appeals to a growing number of consumers who care about social responsibility.

For Kaepernick, it means a renewed level of exposure and support. Since becoming a free agent in 2017, he has been unable to find an NFL contract due to his protests against systemic racism and police brutality. Nike’s endorsement deal has given him a much-needed platform and generated plenty of discussion about the ongoing issue of racism in America. He may not be playing in the NFL anymore, but Kaepernick is still making an impactful difference.

#  What exclusives will be available to Vwin customers who are also Nuggets fans? 

In addition to the wide range of betting options that are available at Vwin, customers who are also Nuggets fans will have access to a selection of exclusive betting options. These include futures bets on the team’s chances of making it to the playoffs, as well as in-game betting on specific matchups.

The Nuggets had an up-and-down season last year, but they are looking to rebound in 2019 and make a playoff run. Vwin is excited to offer its customers exclusive betting options on the team, and we believe they have a real chance of success this year.

#  Will there be any other NBA team partnerships announced in the future?

There are several teams in the NBA that have yet to announce a partnership with a jersey sponsor. These teams include the Atlanta Hawks, Boston Celtics, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers, Memphis Grizzlies, Miami Heat, Milwaukee Bucks, Minnesota Timberwolves, New Orleans Pelicans, Oklahoma City Thunder, Orlando Magic, Philadelphia 76ers, Phoenix Suns, Portland Trail Blazers and Sacramento Kings.

The reason that these teams have yet to partner with a jersey sponsor is because they are still negotiating with different companies. It is possible that one of these teams will announce a partnership in the near future, but it is also possible that they will wait until next year. In addition to these teams, there are several other teams in the NBA that could potentially announce a partnership in the future.
