#  How to File Taxes on Gambling Establishment Winnings in 2017 

Gambling can be an enjoyable pastime, but it can also be a great way to make some extra money. If you've been fortunate enough to win big at a casino or through other gambling activities, you may be wondering how to file your taxes on those winnings.

The good news is that gambling income is taxable, but there are a few things you need to know in order to file your taxes correctly. Here's a guide on how to report gambling winnings on your tax return for 2017.

1. Report Your Winnings

When you file your taxes, you'll need to report all of your gambling income, including winnings and losses. You should report all gambling income in the "Other Income" section of your tax return.

2. Calculate Your Winnings

In order to calculate your taxable gambling income, you'll need to subtract any losses you incurred from your winnings. To do this, simply add up all of your winnings and losses for the year and then subtract the losses from the winnings. This will give you your net gambling income for the year.

3. File as a Self-Employed Individual If Necessary

If you have net gambling income of $400 or more, you'll need to file as a self-employed individual and pay self-employment tax on that income. This tax is in addition to regular federal and state income taxes. However, if your net gambling income is less than $400, you don't need to report it on your tax return.

4. Report Gambling Income as Regular Income

Gambling income is taxed as regular income, so you'll taxed at your usual rate. For example, if you're in the 25% tax bracket, then 25% of your gambling income will be taxed at that rate.

#  Tips for Filing Taxes on Gambling Winnings 


If you are a gambler, you need to be aware of how your winnings are taxed. Here are some tips to help you file your taxes correctly:

1. Report all gambling income. You must report all gambling income on your tax return, including winnings and losses. This includes money won from casino games, lottery tickets, betting pools, and even illegal activities such as underground poker games.

2. Keep track of your losses. You can deduct your gambling losses on your tax return, but only up to the amount of your gambling income. So if you have $1,000 in gambling income and $2,000 in losses, you can only deduct $1,000 on your tax return.

3. Use Form 1040 Schedule A. To report your gambling income and losses, use Form 1040 Schedule A (PDF). This form is used to list all of your taxable and nontaxable income for the year. Be sure to include both your winnings and losses under “Other Miscellaneous Income” on line 21.

4. Claim casino wins as capital gains. If you cashed in any of your casino chips or won a large sum of money from a casino, you may be able to claim the winnings as a capital gain rather than regular income. To do this, you will need to fill out Form 4797 (PDF) and include it with your tax return. For more information on how to claim casino wins as capital gains, see IRS Publication 544 (PDF).

5. Get help if you need it. Tax laws can be complex, so if you are unsure about how to report your gambling income or deductions, it’s best to consult with a tax professional.
