# What streaming service provides Śląsk Wrocław games? 

Now that the 2018-19 season is underway, fans of Śląsk Wrocław are wondering which streaming service will provide their games. Unfortunately, no streaming service has yet announced that they will be broadcasting Śląsk Wrocław’s games. This means that fans will need to rely on other methods to follow their team this season. 

One option is to find a live stream online. There are many websites that offer live streams of football games, and most of them are free. However, there is always a risk that the stream will be taken down or blocked in your area. Additionally, not all games will be available to watch online. 

Another option is to listen to live commentary of the games. This can be done through the club’s official website or one of the many fan websites that compile commentary from different sources. While commentary can be helpful in understanding what is happening on the pitch, it can often be difficult to follow if you are not familiar with the language being spoken. 

Finally, some fans may choose to watch highlights of the game after it has finished. This option is available on most major streaming services, and usually includes all of the goals from the match. It can be a great way to catch up on the game if you were unable to watch it live. 

Overall, there are many ways for Śląsk Wrocław fans to follow their team this season. The best option for each individual will depend on their preferences and availability. We hope that at least one of these options will work for everyone!
